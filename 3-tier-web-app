# Cloud Infrastructure Setup for 3-Tier Web Application

## Description

Implemented a secure and scalable 3-tier AWS environment with EC2 (Nginx) → Application → RDS. Automated deployments using Terraform (IaC) and Jenkins CI/CD, integrated ALB & Auto Scaling, and monitored with CloudWatch.

## Folder Structure

```

```

## Deployment Steps

1. Configure AWS CLI and credentials
2. Initialize and apply Terraform scripts:

```bash
cd terraform/
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

3. Deploy the web application on EC2
4. Setup Jenkins pipeline for CI/CD deployments
5. Verify monitoring and logs in CloudWatch

## Features

* 3-tier architecture (Web → App → Database)
* Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
* CI/CD automation with Jenkins
* Load Balancing with ALB & Auto Scaling
* Monitoring and logging via CloudWatch
* Security best practices (IAM roles, Security Groups, private subnets)
